Reflection for Milestone 4

* There were several things that went well in this assignment, and there were some areas of opportunities.
I'm super glad, despite the fact that I did not finish the last assignment, I was still able to add additional functionality
that I was not able to complete in the last milestone. I feel like I have a better understanding of classes and the logic of going 
through the pixel data in the form of a matrix that makes it easier to visualize. 

* There were a few functions that I was not able to complete because I hadn't solved the problem 
from the last homework assignment, but I finished all but 2 in this assignment. While I know this 
assignment was heavily templated, it was nice to have the chance to practice reading someone
else's code while trying to decipher the logic while understanding what the output. The boarders were 
the most challenging piece of these problems. I spent at least 5 hours working on trying to 
get the boundaries correct, and the logic was incredibly difficult. 

* If I had to make recommendations to other students, I would tell them to collaborate with 
other students in terms of writing the pseudo code because figuring out the logic and how to approach
the problems seem to be my biggest area of opportunity.
